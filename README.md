# 📊 Bias vs Variance Visualizer

A machine learning project to visualize the trade-off between **underfitting (high bias)** and **overfitting (high variance)** using synthetic sine-wave data and polynomial regression.

## 🔍 What It Does
- Generates noisy sine-wave data
- Trains polynomial regression models (degrees 1 to 15)
- Visualizes model predictions, training error, and test error
- Demonstrates how model complexity impacts generalization

## 📈 Sample Output
- Underfitting: Low-degree polynomial (e.g., 1) misses the pattern
- Good Fit: Mid-degree (e.g., 3–5) balances bias & variance
- Overfitting: High-degree (e.g., 10–15) fits noise, not the trend

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Run It Yourself
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells to see visualization and error analysis
